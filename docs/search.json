It was trained to predict log-transformed Albumin levels.\n10-fold cross-validation was used to validate the model, ensuring it performs well across different data subsets.\n\n\n\nModel Evaluation:\n\nThe model’s accuracy was assessed with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared values, where it scored an R-squared of 0.937. This means about 93.7% of the variability in Albumin levels was explained by the model.\nThe RMSE was 0.035, showing the model’s precision in predictions."

For instance, the F value for the interaction between gender and age was 6.652 (p &lt; 0.0001), indicating significant interaction effects.\n\n\n\nApproaches Considered and Rejected:\n\nLogistic Regression: Initially considered for its simplicity in handling binary outcomes, we ultimately did not use logistic regression because our focus was on continuous biochemical markers.\nComplex Multivariate Models: While potentially more robust, these models were deemed too complex for our current analysis scope, potentially complicating the interpretation without providing additional actionable insights.\n\n\n\nReal-World Application:\n\nTailored Treatment Strategies: The insights derived from this analysis are crucial for developing tailored treatment strategies that consider gender differences, potentially improving outcomes for hepatitis C patients.\nEnhanced Disease Understanding: This research enhances our understanding of how hepatitis C interacts with biological differences between genders, which can be pivotal in advancing targeted therapy approaches."
