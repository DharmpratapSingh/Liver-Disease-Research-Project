## **About Me**

Hello! I’m DharmpratapSingh Vaghela, a passionate Data Analytics Engineering student currently pursuing my Master of Science at George Mason University, Fairfax, VA. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in applied analytics, and my hands-on experience in the industry has further honed my skills in data analysis, software development, and predictive modeling.

I have had the opportunity to work as a Full Stack ODOO Developer Intern at Atharva Systems, where I developed a comprehensive web application for real estate agents using a mix of HTML, JavaScript, MySQL, and the ODOO framework. This experience significantly improved my understanding of both front-end and back-end development, as well as database management.

I’m always eager to learn and grow in the field of data science, and I’m looking forward to applying my skills to solve real-world problems. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/dharmpratapsingh-vaghela-3465601b7/) or reach out via email at dharmpratapv\@gmail.com .
