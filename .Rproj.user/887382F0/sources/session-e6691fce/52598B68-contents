**Welcome to Our Liver Disease Research Project**

We are excited to share our collaborative research on liver disease, specifically exploring how liver enzyme levels change with age and gender among individuals with hepatitis C. This project has been a significant endeavor for our team, combining our expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and healthcare. Our team, consisting of:

1.  Harkirat Singh

2.  Shukan Nikikumar Prajapati

3.  DharmpratapSingh ArunodaySingh Vaghela

has worked extensively to provide insights that could contribute to better health outcomes.

Together, we’ve utilized advanced statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and thorough data analysis to uncover patterns and insights that can aid in better diagnosis and treatment of liver diseases.

We invite you to explore the research findings, methodologies, and visualizations that we’ve compiled. This website serves as a platform to present our work and the impact it could have on understanding liver health.
